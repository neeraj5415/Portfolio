            <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed text-lg">
                Hello! I'm <strong>Neeraj Kumar</strong>, a 24-year-old passionate and dedicated 
                <span class="text-green-600 font-semibold"> Frontend / Full-Stack Web Developer </span> 
                currently based in <strong> Fazilpur, Sector 72, Gurugram, Haryana </strong>. 
                My journey into tech has been a unique blend of determination, curiosity, and adaptability.
            </p>

            <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed text-lg">
                I completed my schooling from <strong class="text-green-600 font-semibold">OHMIC Jakholi, Rudraprayag </strong>, scoring 
                <strong> 76% </strong> in 10th (2016) and <strong> 62% </strong> in 12th (2018). 
                Later, I earned my Diploma in <strong> Mechanical Engineering </strong> 
                from <strong class="text-green-600 font-semibold"> Tula‚Äôs Institute, Dehradun </strong>, graduating in 2021 with a solid <strong>70%</strong>.
            </p>

            <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed text-lg">
                After graduation, I spent over 1.6 years working in the mechanical industry as a 
                <strong class="text-green-600 font-semibold"> machine operator and sales executive </strong>. While the work was hands-on and challenging, 
                I realized my passion was elsewhere ‚Äî in building digital experiences and solving problems through code.
            </p>

            <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed text-lg">
                That‚Äôs when I made a bold decision: I left my job and started learning programming on my own
                on <strong> Aguest 2023</strong>, I earned a <span class="text-green-600 font-medium">scholarship at Coding Ninjas in June 2024</span>, 
                which marked the beginning of a serious and structured journey into web development.
